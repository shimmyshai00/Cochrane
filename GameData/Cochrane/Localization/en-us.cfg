        #LOC_Cochrane_WarpCore_Small_Title = Mk. 1 'Mighty Mite' Warp Core
        #LOC_Cochrane_WarpCore_Small_Mfg = Zefram Kerman's Ad Astra
        #LOC_Cochrane_WarpCore_Small_Description = A cute little warp core, but it sure packs a punch! It uses a stream of antimatter to annihilate deuterium into a supernova-hot stream of warp plasma. Requires a small chunk of Dilithium to modulate the reaction. One year's worth is included, but the warranty on that is void if you push those engines to the point they can't take it any more! Finally, while the reaction is phenomenally efficient, it's not 100% so - so pack a few radiators to keep it chillaxed.
        
        #LOC_Cochrane_WarpNacelle_Small_Title = Mk. 1 'Coil-o-Matic' Warp Nacelle
        #LOC_Cochrane_WarpNacelle_Small_Mfg = Zefram Kerman's Ad Astra
        #LOC_Cochrane_WarpNacelle_Small_Description = Provides the warp nacelles for the Mk. 1 warp drive system. Warp Nacelles contain the special coils which are used to generate the warp fields that move the ship at faster-than-light speed.

        #LOC_Cochrane_WarpFieldGenerator_Small_Title = Mk. 1 'Sergeant' Warp Field Generator
        #LOC_Cochrane_WarpFieldGenerator_Small_Mfg = Zefram Kerman's Ad Astra
        #LOC_Cochrane_WarpFieldGenerator_Small_Description = Completing the trifecta, this is the warp field generator for the Mk. 1 warp drive system. This generator can push most ships up to warp 1.5, and requires 1.21 GW of warp plasma power to push itself over warp 1. Orient carefully - if it is pointed the wrong way, your ship will move the wrong way, too. Fortunately, there are little arrows on the generator to clue you in.

        #LOC_Cochrane_Message_WarpCoilFlameOut = Flame-Out - Warp coils stopping due to insufficient warp plasma
        #LOC_Cochrane_Message_WarpFieldCollapsed = Unstart - warp field collapsed!
        #LOC_Cochrane_Message_WarpCoilChargeSlow = Warp coil is charging slow due to scarce plasma
        #LOC_Cochrane_Message_WarpCoilChargeFail = Warp coil charger failure - insufficient warp plasma
        #LOC_Cochrane_Message_NotEnoughWarpCoils = Warp field generator is inoperable on this ship due to insufficient warp coils
        #LOC_Cochrane_Message_NoWarpPlasma = Unable to start warp - field generator did not receive warp plasma
        #LOC_Cochrane_Message_CoilsInactive = Unable to start warp - check warp coil status
        #LOC_Cochrane_Message_NotEnoughCharge = Cannot sustain warp field due to lack of coil charge
        #LOC_Cochrane_Message_EmrgThrottleDown = Low warp plasma - throttling back!
        #LOC_Cochrane_Message_GravityTooHigh = Gravitational fields in this sector are too high - get further into deep space

        #LOC_Cochrane_Message_WarpCoreDilithiumToast = Warp Core Breakdown - Dilithium Crystals Failure
